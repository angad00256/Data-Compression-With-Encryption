# Data-Compression-With-Encryption
The project aims at compressing textual data and encrypting the compressed file to avoid unintended use. The algorithm assigns a unique code to each different character in a text file with a code length of less than 8-bits with the goal to store more than 1 character in a byte. Encrypted data is then decompressed for retrieving original data.
